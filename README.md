Flappy Bird Game
Game Overview:
Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The player earns points by successfully navigating the bird through the openings between the pipes. The game is known for its simplicity yet challenging gameplay, which requires precise timing and coordination.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Controls: The player controls the bird by clicking the mouse or pressing the space bar. Each click or press causes the bird to flap its wings and ascend slightly. When not flapping, the bird descends due to gravity.
Objective: The main objective is to navigate the bird through as many sets of pipes as possible without crashing into them or the ground.
Scoring: The player earns a point for each set of pipes successfully passed. The score is displayed in real-time during the game and the highest score achieved is recorded as the high score.
Game Over: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. A "Game Over" popup is displayed, showing the player's final score and the high score, with an option to retry the game.
Features:

Start and Retry: The game starts only after the player clicks a "Start" button. If the game ends, a popup appears with a "Retry" button to restart the game.
Visual Appeal:
The bird, pipes, and background are replaced with visually appealing images.
The scoreboard is prominently displayed at the top right corner of the canvas.
A high score feature is included, showing the highest score achieved during the session.
The game over popup displays the final score and high score.
The game canvas has a pattern border and the background outside the canvas features a gradient for added visual effect.
Animated Start Text: An animated text prompts the player to start the game, adding to the visual appeal.
Technical Implementation:

HTML: Sets up the structure of the game, including the canvas for the game display and elements for the scoreboard and popups.
CSS: Styles the game elements, including the canvas, scoreboard, and game over popup, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, handling user inputs, game mechanics (like gravity and collision detection), and updating the display based on game events.
The combination of simple controls, challenging gameplay, and visually appealing design makes Flappy Bird an engaging and addictive game.
